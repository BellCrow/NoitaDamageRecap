# NoitaDamageRecap
You ever played Noita and after dying asked yourself: "Where did all my health left ? I barely got hit by anything"

You no longer have to ask yourself that question. Instead get it answered by this helpful little tool.

I have mostly creatd this little mod to practice lua but as it turned out it can be actually useful if you want to know what damage to look out for during your playthrough.

You can choose between different ways on how to aggregate the shown damage numbers. At the moment the following modes are available:

* Damage type

* Damage type simplified

* Damage based on enemy
