# NoitaDamageRecap
You ever played Noita and after dying asked yourself: "Where did all my health left ? I barely got hit by anything"

You no longer have to ask yourself that question. Instead get it answered by this helpful little tool.

I have mostly created this mod to practice lua but as it turned out it can be actually useful if you want to know what damage to look out for during your playthrough.

I especially put effort into the architecture to make sure the code is understandable.

If you have ideas pr something that bugs you, you can create an issue here on github.

## What does it do exactly ?

You can choose between different ways on how to aggregate the shown damage numbers. At the moment the following modes are available:

* Damage type

* Damage type simplified
